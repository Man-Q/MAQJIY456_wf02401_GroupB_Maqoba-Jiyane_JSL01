# Syntax-Engine Interaction Project

This project is part of [JSL01] Project for the Syntax-Engine Interaction challenge.

## Introduction

This project involves creating a JavaScript function to validate pet adoption details on a virtual pet adoption website. The function ensures that the input string follows a specific syntax: it must start with "pet_" followed by a combination of letters and numbers. If the syntax is correct, it returns "Valid Syntax"; otherwise, it returns "Invalid Syntax."

## Features

- Validates pet adoption details syntax.
- Provides feedback on whether the syntax is valid or not.

## Installation

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the [Syntax-Engine Interaction Challenge Starter Code](https://github.com/example/syntax-engine-interaction-starter-code) repository to your local development environment.
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Modify the `script.js` file to complete the `validateSyntax` function according to the project instructions.
4. Save the changes.
5. Open the `index.html` file in a browser (preferably using Live Server if available).
6. Enter pet adoption details in the input box and click the validate button to test the function.
7. Debug any errors in the browser console.

## Usage
