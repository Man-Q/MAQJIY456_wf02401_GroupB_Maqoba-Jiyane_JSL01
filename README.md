Syntax-Engine Interaction Project
This project is part of [JSL01] Project for the Syntax-Engine Interaction challenge.

Introduction
In this project, we aim to create a JavaScript function that validates pet adoption details entered by users on a virtual pet adoption website. The function checks whether the input string follows a specific syntax, starting with "pet_" followed by a combination of letters and numbers. If the syntax is correct, it returns "Valid Syntax"; otherwise, it returns "Invalid Syntax."

Features
Validates pet adoption details syntax.
Provides feedback on whether the syntax is valid or not.
Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the provided Starter Code Repository from the Syntax-Engine Interaction Challenge Starter Code to your local development environment (e.g., VSCode).
Open the cloned project in your code editor.
Modify the script.js file to complete the validateSyntax function according to the project instructions.
Save the changes.
Open the index.html file in a browser (preferably using Live Server if available).
Enter different pet adoption details in the input box and click the validate button to test the function.
Ensure that your solution works for a variety of inputs and debug any errors in the browser console.
Usage
Once the project is set up and running, follow these steps to use it:

Open the index.html file in a browser.
Enter pet adoption details in the input box.
Click the validate button to see if the syntax is valid or not.
Review the result displayed on the page.
